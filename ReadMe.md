# Silksong Start Screen
A Hollow Knight mod that replaces the game's title screen with a Silksong-themed start screen.

Currently, this version only replaces the logo and does **not** replace the backgroundâ€”mainly due to the lack of high-quality resources. For the best visual match, it's recommended to use the _Grimm_ background.
